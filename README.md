# FinTrack: A Personal Finance & Expense Tracker

> A modern, user-friendly mobile application designed to help students and young professionals take control of their personal finances with ease and clarity.

## About The App

FinTrack is more than just an expense logger; it's a comprehensive tool for financial wellness. The app provides a clear overview of spending habits, helps users set and achieve savings goals, automates the tracking of recurring bills, and offers curated learning content to improve financial literacy. Our goal is to empower users to make smarter financial decisions by providing them with the right tools and knowledge.

This project is being developed as a final requirement for the Mobile Programming course.

## Features 

Our development roadmap includes the following core features:

#### 1. Dashboard & Expense Tracking
*   The central hub of the application. Users can see a quick summary of their income vs. expenses, view a categorical breakdown of their spending in a visual chart, and see a list of their most recent transactions. All new transactions are added from this screen.

#### 2. Goal-Oriented Savings Tracker
*   A motivational tool that allows users to create specific financial goals (e.g., "New Laptop," "Vacation Fund"). The app helps track progress by allowing users to contribute funds towards these goals, visualizing how close they are to achieving them.

#### 3. Recurring Payments Management
*   Automates the tedious task of logging regular expenses. Users can set up recurring payments like monthly subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify) or bills (rent, internet), and the app will automatically log these transactions on the scheduled date.

#### 4. Financial Learning Hub
*   A dedicated section with curated content to enhance users' financial knowledge. This feature will provide recommendations for insightful books, articles, and videos on topics like budgeting, investing, and saving.

#### 5. User Profile & Settings
*   A standard section for managing user account information, setting preferences (like currency), and accessing app-related information.
